# Role-Based Healthcare Management System

## **Overview**
This is a **role-based EDSUU - BAY healthcare management system** developed by me and two of my friends as part of a hackathon project where we secured **2nd place**. The platform enables nurses, doctors, and workers to collaborate effectively in managing patient care. We used a Django-based template for the design and implementation.
